Summary
-------
PSSH2 is a collection of tools for creating the sequence-to-structure alignment database PSSH2.

For convenience, the hhsuite, that is used in PSSH2, is also included in this repository. 
The hhsuite is developed and maintained by Soeding and his team at ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/pub/HH-suite/
or as a debian package.

In this repository, the data directory contains all the PSSH2 data that is small enough
to be distributed in a git repository. For the rest, there are just stubs to indicate 
which directories exist at Rostlab.

The src directory contains two main subdirectories, the one for generating and updating pdb_full,
and the one for generating and updating pssh2. 


Setup
------

For pdb_full: Change paths in the scripts if you move to another place! 
(set in the beginning of renew_pdb_full.sh)



Usage
------

Updating pdb_full:
src/pdb_full/renew_pdb_full.sh -u -d <db_name> > & update_pdb_full.log &
Redoing pdb_full from scratch:
src/pdb_full/renew_pdb_full.sh -d <db_name> > & renew_pdb_full.log &

Generating PSSH:
see src/pssh2/pssh2_seq -h
