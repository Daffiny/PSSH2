NAME
  find_best_pdb_for_seqres_md5 - find a pdb code and chain that best represents the SEQRES sequence 
SYNOPSIS
  find_best_pdb_for_seqres_md5 <-m md5> 
DESCRIPTION
  find_best_pdb_for_seqres_md5 takes an input md5 and runs searches on the pdb tables in Aquaria
  selection criteria are:
  1. find a structure with as much overlap between SEQRES and coordinates as possible
  2. select an X-ray structure 
  2a. slect an X-ray structure with good resolution
  3. select a new structure  
OPTIONS
  -h          The option -h displays help and exits.
  -d          Debug option: be verbose
  -m		  md5 sum of SEQRES sequence to search

# how to find the best resolution pdb for a given md5: 
# select c.pdb_id, c.chain, p.`Resolution`, p.`Experimental_Method` from PDB_chain c, PDB p where c.`MD5_Hash` = '7838b037ee471235d77ba2a140f0cba7' and c.`PDB_ID` = p.`PDB_ID` and  p.`Experimental_Method`='X-ray diffraction' order by resolution limit 1;
#
# how to get the most recent pdb for a given md5:
# select c.pdb_id, c.chain, p.Published, p.`Experimental_Method` from PDB_chain c, PDB p where c.`MD5_Hash` = '7838b037ee471235d77ba2a140f0cba7' and c.`PDB_ID` = p.`PDB_ID` order by Published limit desc 1;
#
# how to get all chains for a a given md5
# select c.pdb_id, c.chain, c.`Align_to_SEQRES` from PDB_chain c where c.`MD5_Hash`='7838b037ee471235d77ba2a140f0cba7';
#
# how to get the best pdb id for the secondary structure for a given md5: 
# select c.pdb_id, c.chain,  c.`Align_to_SEQRES`, p.`Resolution`, p.`Experimental_Method`,  p.Published  from PDB_chain c, PDB p where c.`MD5_Hash` = '7838b037ee471235d77ba2a140f0cba7' and c.`PDB_ID` = p.`PDB_ID`;
# then interprete the align_to_seqres in a dedicated script to find the longest match, and also to choose the best resolution / most recent structure
