RENEW
-----
use renew_pdb_full.sh to generate a completely new pdb_full (or update: -u)
renew_pdb_full.sh has a number of dependencies:
from HHLIB: (export HHLIB=/mnt/project/pssh/hhsuite-2.0.13)
 /mnt/project/pssh/hhsuite-2.0.13/scripts/pdb2fasta.non_redundant_chains_AS.pl
 /mnt/project/pssh/hhsuite-2.0.13/scripts/splitfasta.pl
 /mnt/project/pssh/hhsuite-2.0.13/scripts/multithread.pl
 /mnt/project/pssh/hhsuite-2.0.13/scripts/addss.pl
 /mnt/project/pssh/hhsuite-2.0.13/scripts/hhblitsdb.pl
locally:
 pdb_redundant_chains-md5-seq-mapping.pl
 master_submit_hhblits.pl
 removeKnownSeqs.pl

example command: 
renew_pdb_full.sh -v -d db_2013_02_25 > & update_pdb_full.db_2013_02_25.log &


UPDATE
------
update_pdb_full.sh is now obsolete, because the functionality has been
moved into 'renew_pdb_full.sh -u' 

The difference between update and renew is that for update the a3m and hmm
files of the last process will be conserved. Update will only look for
new pdb files and add them to the database. 

example command:
renew_pdb_full.sh -u -v -d db_2013_02_25 > & update_pdb_full.db_2013_02_25.log &

DO NOT FORGET:
Once renew has run successfully, move the seq files from
.../data/pdb_derived/seqNew to .../data/pdb_derived/seq!
The files listed in .../data/pdb_derived/seq define the list of known sequences.


REST
----
The other files in this directory are either defunct or work in progress.
