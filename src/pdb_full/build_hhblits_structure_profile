NAME
  build_hhblits_structure_profile - generate a new pdb_full database 
SYNOPSIS
  make_new_pdb_full [-R|-F n]  [-v] <-m md5List> <-d dbName> 
DESCRIPTION
  make_new_pdb_full iterates over sequences given in the md5List (coming fron the pdb table of Aquaria),
  runs build_hhblits_profile for each sequence (to get a3m files),
  runs addss.pl on each a3m file (based on the best pdb structure for the sequence),
  links the output a3m files to the psipred a3m directory
  and finally runs hhblitsdb.pl on the psipred a3m directory.
  This script assumes that the sequences given in the md5List are valid sequences,
  any sorting out of DNA sequences, short sequences or some with too many non-amino acid residues
  must happen in the process that constructs the md5List. 
OPTIONS
  -d          output name for new pdb_full
  -m          file containing pdb Seqres md5s to run over 
  -F n        Set force remaking status for making of HMM profile (run build_hhblits_profile):
     0           do not make profile unless none exists
     1           run only if the profile is older than the last update of uniprot20 (default)
     2           always run, even if the profile exists 
  -R          Retain (DO NOT remake) the HMM profile (same as -F 0)
  -v          be verbose
  -u          /path/to/uniprot_20_files (without extensions)
  -c          number of cpus hhblits should run in parallel (default $n_cpu)
