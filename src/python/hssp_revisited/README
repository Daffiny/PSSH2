pythonscript.py

Prompts two things:
- csv file name: Enter the name you want your result csv file to be named after. No file suffix
- md5 checksum: Enter the checksum of the protein you want to look at

if you want to preserve all the temporary data the script generates, set the boolean cleanup = False (Line 19)
maxclres.log should NOT be present when executing the script! If you disabled the cleanup, you probably have to delete maxclres.log manually
before starting the script.
