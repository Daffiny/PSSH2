NAME
  pp_pssh2 - generate pssh2 type sequence-to-structrue alignments for PredictProtein
SYNOPSIS
  pp_pssh2 [-s] 
DESCRIPTION
  pp_pssh2 takes an input sequence and generates sequence-to-structure alignments 
  for this sequence. 
  To this end, it starts the two subsequent HHblits runs:
  1) build_hhblits_profile: search against uniprot20 database of HMMs and generate a 
      HHM output (HMM-profile)
  2) scan_structures_hhblits: starting with the HHM output from step 1,
      search against the pdb_full database of HMMs and generate a HHR ouput
  Subsequently, it parses the HHR output from the second run using the "parse_hhr_for_pssh2" 
  perl script and generates a .pssh2 file.
  Finally, this outputfile is read into the MySQL database pssh2_local, using
